## Definition

The custom connector allows you to use your own source code in your [actions](https://php-etl.github.io/documentation/core-concept/action/),
allowing you to connect tools that are not supported by the standard distribution.

## Installation

This feature is already integrated into the Satellite package, so you canâ€™t require it with the composer.

## Usage

First you need to [determine your services](../../feature/services) in your pipeline or workflow and then use the `use`
option which allows you to define which service to use.

```yaml
    
```
