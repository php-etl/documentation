### What is Batch ? 

Originally written to be used in [Akeneo PIM](https://www.akeneo.com/).

This extraction aims to make it usable outside of the Akeneo PIM project.
This package enables the automation of a series of commands executed in series on a computer without the need for an operator to intervene.

Please consider that this process is still in a very experimental stage.

We don't have all the tests and automation which could ensure that this component will work smoothly outside of the Akeneo PIM full stack.
