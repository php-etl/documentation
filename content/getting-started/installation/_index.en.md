Starting from here we will work inside a project directory we will name `my_project_directory`.

```shell
mkdir my_project_directory && cd my_project_directory
```

Once the project dir is created and you have changed your current directory to it, the first task will be to initialize 
a composer project inside this directory and add all required dependencies.

```shell
composer init
```

> Notice: You must choose `dev` as the value for the `minimum-stability` option.

> When asked if you want to define your require and require-dev dependencies interactively, answer `no`.

In the auto-generated `composer.json` file, add the following lines at the end :

```json
{
  // ...
  "config": {
    "bin-dir": "bin"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "post-install-cmd": [
      "Kiboko\\Component\\Satellite\\ComposerScripts::postInstall"
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
      "Kiboko\\Component\\Satellite\\ComposerScripts::postUpdate"
    ]
  }
}
```

Now, your environment is ready for the satellite compiler installation. The following command will install it.

```shell
composer require php-etl/satellite
```
