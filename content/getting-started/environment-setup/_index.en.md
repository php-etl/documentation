### Composer 2

After installing PHP, you must ensure that Composer 2 is installed on your machine.

### JQ

Jq, a JSON processor, is also required for satellites to generate their composer.json files.

### Docker (optional)

Gyroscops offers you the possibility to build your configurations as images that you can use in a dockerized environment.
That's why you may also need Docker.
