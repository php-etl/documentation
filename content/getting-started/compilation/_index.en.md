After checking and verifying that the configuration of your pipelines are correct, you will be able to compile your configuration.

In a terminal, write the following command :

```shell
# php bin/satellite build <path-to-your-config-file>
php bin/satellite build satellite.yaml
```

> Notice: You will need to run this command every time you change your configuration files.
