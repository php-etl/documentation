Next, we will guide you through the configuration process and explain how to use our different plugins.

The first thing to do is creating a configuration file which we will call `satellite.yaml`.

To avoid keeping all our files at the root of the project, we will create `satellite.yaml` inside a `src/` folder.

In a terminal, enter the following command:

```shell
mkdir src && touch src/satellite.yaml
```

Then add this configuration to your YAML file:

```yaml
version: '0.3'
satellites:
  csv_to_json:
    label: 'CSV to JSON'
    filesystem:
        path: build
    pipeline:
      steps:
        - csv:
            extractor:
              file_path: 'data/products.csv'
        - json:
            loader:
              file_path: 'output.json'

```

In our case, we use `csv` as an extractor and `json` as a loader, so we have to add the corresponding plugins to our project:

```shell
composer require php-etl/csv-plugin:'*' php-etl/json-plugin:'*'
```

Composer will install a version of the plugin that is compatible with the `php-etl/satellite` package you have previously installed.
Find the different versions of our plugins [here](https://packagist.org/?query=php-etl%2F).

> In a configuration file, paths start at the folder specified under `filesystem.path`. Here for example, the result will be `src/build/output.csv`.
