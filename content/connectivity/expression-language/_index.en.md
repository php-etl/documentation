# Expression Language

- [Array Expression Language](#array-expression-language)
- [Satellite Expression Language](#satellite-expression-language)

We have developed packages that provide functions that allow us to use expressions inside configuration for more complex logic.

These packages are based on the [ExpressionLanguage](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/expression_language.html) component of Symfony.

## Array Expression Language

[See the Array Expression Language documentation](../expression-language/array-expression-language).

## Satellite Expression Language

[See the Satellite Expression Language documentation](../expression-language/satellite-expression-language).
