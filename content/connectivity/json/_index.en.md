## What is it for?

This plugin aims at integrating a JSON, NDJSON and JSON-LD extractor and loader into the [Pipeline](https://github.com/php-etl/pipeline)
stack.

## Installation

In a Satellite project, add the JSON plugin this way:

```shell
composer require php-etl/json-plugin
```

## Usage

### Building an extractor

To build an extractor, you need to specify the path of your file with the `file_path` option.

{{< tabs name="extractor" >}}

{{< tab name="YAML" codelang="yaml"  >}}

json:
  extractor:
    file_path: 'input.json'

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}

### Building a loader


To build a loader, you need to specify the path to your file with the `file_path` option.

{{< tabs name="loader" >}}

{{< tab name="YAML" codelang="yaml"  >}}

json:
  loader:
    file_path: 'output.json'

{{< /tab >}}

{{< /tabs >}}
