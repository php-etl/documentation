## What is it ?

The Akeneo plugin aims at integration the Akeneo PHP clients into the
[Pipeline](https://github.com/php-etl/pipeline) stack. This integration is
compatible with both [Akeneo Enterprise Edition client](https://github.com/akeneo/api-php-client-ee)
and the [Akeneo Community Edition client](https://github.com/akeneo/api-php-client).

## Installation

```shell
composer require php-etl/akeneo-plugin
```

## Usage

### Connecting to Akeneo

To establish a connection to your Akeneo PIM, you must specify its URL and some connection identifiers
(`client_id`, `secret`, `username`, `password`).

```yaml
akeneo:
  # ...
  client:
    api_url: 'http://demo.akeneo.com'
    client_id: '414yc7d9mnk044ko4wswgw80o8ssw80gssos488kk8ogss40ko'
    secret: '4k8ee6n44m4gkkg0coc8o4w4coscw0w4cg0wg8sc0wsk0sw8gs'
    username: 'demo_9573'
    password: '516f3e3e5'
```

To retrieve these identifiers, you need to add a
[connection](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/v4/updates/connections.html) in your Akeneo PIM.

### Using the enterprise version

The `enterprise` option allows you to use the enterprise features in Akeneo and uses the Enterprise client accordingly. By default, it's set to `false`.

```yaml
akeneo:
  enterprise: true
  # ...
```

### Building an extractor

In the configuration of your extractor, you must specify the `type` of resource you will be working on
and which `method you want to use to retrieve your data.

The list of available resources is quite long depend on the edition of your Akeneo (Enterprise, Growth or Community).

For a Community Edition or Growth Edition, you can choose between this types of resources : `product`, `category`, `attribute`,
`attributeOption`, `attributeGroup`, `family`, `productMediaFile`, `locale`, `channel`, `currency`, `measureFamily`,
`associationType`, `familyVariant`, `productModel`.

For an Enterprise Edition, you will be able to use in addition to the resources present in the Community Edition :
`publishedProduct`, `productModelDraft`, `productDraft`, `asset`, `assetCategory`, `assetTag`, `referenceEntityRecord`,
`referenceEntityAttribute`, `referenceEntityAttributeOption`, `referenceEntity`.

For each resource, the following 3 methods are available :
- `all` : retrieves all data from a table
- `get` : retrieve a row from a table
- `listPerPage` : retrieves a set number of data from a table

```yaml
akeneo:
  extractor:
    type: product
    method: all
  logger:
    type: stderr
  client:
    api_url: 'http://demo.akeneo.com/'
    client_id: '414yc7d9mnk044ko4wswgw80o8ssw80gssos488kk8ogss40ko'
    secret: '4k8ee6n44m4gkkg0coc8o4w4coscw0w4cg0wg8sc0wsk0sw8gs'
    username: 'demo_9573'
    password: '516f3e3e5'
```

### Building a lookup

In some cases, you will need to perform some lookups to append to the data already read some complementary data coming from a secondary data source;
this is called a lookup.

In the configuration of your lookup, you must specify the `type` of resource you will be working on
and which `method` you want to use to retrieve your data.

The list of available resources is quite long and depends on the edition of your Akeneo (Enterprise, Growth or Community).
The options available are the same as for the [loader](#building-a-loader).

The `merge` option allows you to add data to your dataset, in a sense merging your actual dataset with your new data.

The `map` option comes from the [FastMap](../../../connectivity/fast-map) plugin, you may need to read its documentation
to understand how to use it properly.

```yaml
akeneo:
  lookup:
    type: product
    method: all
    merge:
      map:
        - field: '[options]'
          expression: 'lookup["code"]'
  client:
    api_url: 'http://demo.akeneo.com/'
    client_id: '414yc7d9mnk044ko4wswgw80o8ssw80gssos488kk8ogss40ko'
    secret: '4k8ee6n44m4gkkg0coc8o4w4coscw0w4cg0wg8sc0wsk0sw8gs'
    username: 'demo_9573'
    password: '516f3e3e5'
```

### Building a conditional lookup

The conditional lookup is very similar to a regular lookup, at the difference that the lookup will be performed only if some conditions
are full-filled.

In this configuration, you will find options very similar to a standard lookup, difference being on 2 new levels of encapsulation, one of them containing the condition.

```yaml
akeneo:
  lookup:
    conditional:
      - condition: '@=(input["type"] in ["pim_catalog_simpleselect", "pim_catalog_multipleselect"])'
        type: attributeOption
        code: '@=input["code"]'
        method: listPerPage
        search:
          - { field: enabled, operator: '=', value: '@=input["code"]', scope: '@=input["code"]', locale: '@=input["fr_FR"]' }
        merge:
          map:
            - field: '[options]'
              expression: 'join("|", lookup["code"])'
      - condition: '@=(input["type"] in ["akeneo_reference_entity", "akeneo_reference_entity_collection"])'
        type: referenceEntityRecord
        code: '@=input["code"]'
        method: listPerPage
        search:
          - { field: enabled, operator: '=', value: '@=input["code"]', scope: '@=input["code"]', locale: '@=input["fr_FR"]' }
        merge:
          map:
            - field: '[options]'
              expression: 'join("|", lookup["code"])'
  # ...
```

### Building a loader

In the configuration of your loader, you must specify the `type` of resource you are going to write
and which `method` you want to use to insert your data.

The list of available resources is quite long and dÃ©pends on your Akeneo edition (Enterprise, Growth or Community).

For a Community Edition or Growth Edition, you can choose between these types of resources: `product`, `category`, `attribute`,
`attributeOption`, `attributeGroup`, `family`, `productMediaFile`, `locale`, `channel`, `currency`, `measureFamily`,
`associationType`, `familyVariant`, `productModel`.

For an Enterprise Edition, you will be able to use in addition to the resources present in the Community Edition:
`publishedProduct`,
`productModelDraft`, `productDraft`, `asset`, `assetCategory`, `assetTag`, `referenceEntityRecord`, `referenceEntityAttribute`,
`referenceEntityAttributeOption`, `referenceEntity`.

For each resource, the following 4 methods are available :

- `create`: insert a new resource
- `upsert`: will try to update the resource, otherwise the resource will be created
- `upsertList`: will try to update a resources list, otherwise the resources will be created
- `delete`: delete a resource from the table

```yaml
akeneo:
  loader:
    type: products
    method: create
  logger:
    type: stderr
  client:
    api_url: 'http://demo.akeneo.com/'
    client_id: '414yc7d9mnk044ko4wswgw80o8ssw80gssos488kk8ogss40ko'
    secret: '4k8ee6n44m4gkkg0coc8o4w4coscw0w4cg0wg8sc0wsk0sw8gs'
    username: 'demo_9573'
    password: '516f3e3e5'
```

## Advanced Usage

### Filtering your search

In some cases, you may only want to retrieve data that matches specific criteria.

When performing a search, you need to specify certain options :

- `field` : the field you want to search
- `operator` : the operator of your search
- `value` : the value of the field you want to search

Other options are available but are not essential in your search :

- `scope` : scope in which you search
- `locale` : code of the locale you are looking for


```yaml
akeneo:
  extractor:
    # ...
    search:
      - { field: enabled, operator: '=', value: true }
      - { field: completeness, operator: '>', value: 70, scope: ecommerce }
```

You may need to read the [filtering documentation of Akeneo API](https://api.akeneo.com/documentation/filter.html)
### Using ExpressionLanguage

The plugin takes into account the [ExpressionLanguage](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/expression_language.html)
component provided by Symfony.

We have also provided [custom expression](../../akeneo/expression-language) to use when mapping your data.

```yaml
akeneo:
  expression_language:
    - 'Kiboko\Component\ExpressionLanguage\Akeneo\AkeneoFilterProvider'
  # ...
```
