## What is it?

The Prestashop plugin aims at connecting a Prestashop instance through its API using a [pipeline](../../core-concept/pipeline).

Currently, the following resources are supported by the plugin: `categories`, `combinations`, `manufacturers`, `product_features`, `product_feature_values`, `product_options`, `product_option_values`, `products`, `shops`, `stock_availables`, `suppliers`, `tax_rule_groups`, `tax_rules`.

## Installation

```shell
composer require "php-etl/prestashop-plugin:*"
```

## Usage

### Building an extractor

```yaml
prestashop:
  client:
    url: 'https://prestashop.example.com' # the base URL of your Prestashop main website
    api_key: 'abc1234'                    # the access key to the API
  extractor:
    type: 'products'                      # the resource type you wish to retrieve
    method: 'all'                         # the retrieval method, currently it should always be 'all'.
```

#### Optional parameters:

```yaml

# ...
    options:

        - 'id'           # by default all the fields will be retrieved, which can have
        - 'product_type' # an impact on the performance of your pipelines
        - 'price'
      filter:            # filter the result based on a value, or a range of values
        id: '[1,10]'
      sorters:           # sorting fields and their direction
        id: "ASC"
      id_shop: 1         # identifier of the shop containing the data you want to extract data from
      id_group_shop: 1
      price:             # list the price requests you want the API to calculate for you
        my_price:        # each element in this list is an individual price request you 
                         # will ask, that will be retrieved through an individual field
          quantity: 25
