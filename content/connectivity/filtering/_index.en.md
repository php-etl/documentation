## What is it?

The Filtering plugin can reject data, which prevents it from advancing in the pipeline, based on a condition.

## Installation

This plugin is already integrated into the Satellite package, so you canâ€™t require it with composer.

## Usage

### Dropping a line

For example, this will ignore the line if the field "`identifier`" is missing, using the [array expression](../../feature/expression-language/array-expression-functions#generic-functions) `keyExists`:

```yaml
- filter:
    drop:
      - when: '@=!keyExists("identifier", input)'
```

### Rejecting a line

This is equivalent to dropping a line, but when paired with a [rejection configuration](../../feature/rejection) you will be able to log information about the dropped line.

This will ignore a line where the field "`image`" is empty, and store that data in some destination:

```yaml
- filter:
    reject:
      - when: '@=input["identifier"] === null'
    rejection:
      destinations:
        # ...
```

### Serializer

In some case, you can have an object returned by the api instead of an array.
And this object isn't serializable or can't be encoded in json ?

You can use our new option, the rejection_serializer !

This option allowed you to use an expression to normalize your object and have its data on the rejection data.

```yaml
- filter:
    reject:
      - when: '@=input["identifier"] === null'
        rejection_serializer: '@=normalize(input)'
    rejection:
      destinations:
        # ...
```
