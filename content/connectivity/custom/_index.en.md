## Definition

The custom plugin allows you to use your own source code in your [pipelines](https://php-etl.github.io/documentation/components/pipeline/),
allowing you to connect tools that are not supported by the standard distribution.

## Installation

This plugin is already integrated into the Satellite package, so you canâ€™t require it with the composer.

## Usage

Unlike other plugins, the configuration is the same whether it is an extractor, a transformer or a loader.

First you need to [determine your services](../../feature/services) in your pipeline or workflow and then use the `use` 
option which allows you to define which service to use.

### Building an extractor

```yaml
custom:
  extractor:
    use: 'App\Class\Bar'
```

### Building a transformer

```yaml
custom:
  transformer:
    use: 'App\Class\Bar'
```

### Building a loader

```yaml
custom:
  loader:
    use: 'App\Class\Bar'
```
