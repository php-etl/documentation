## What is it ?

This package allows you to create an API that will serve a single endpoint.

The goal is to be able to send data to this endpoint, to process it in a series of steps.

## Installation

``` 
composer require php-etl/workflow
```

## Basic usage

Your HTTP Hook will serve the route set in the option `path`:

```yaml
version: '0.3'
satellites:
  my_satellite:
    label: 'Example of an api'
    filesystem:
      path: build
    composer:
      require:
        - "middlewares/uuid:dev-master"
        - "middlewares/base-path:dev-master"
        - "middlewares/request-handler:dev-master"
        - "middlewares/fast-route:dev-master"
        - "laminas/laminas-diactoros"
        - "laminas/laminas-httphandlerrunner"
        - "nyholm/psr7-server"
        - "nyholm/psr7"
        - "php-etl/pipeline"
        - "php-etl/satellite"
        - "php-etl/api-runtime"
        - "php-etl/mapping-contracts"
    http_hook:
      name: 'My HTTP Hook' # Optional
      path: /my-api
      expression: 'input'
      pipeline:
        steps:
          - fastmap:
              map:
                - field: '[sku]'
                  copy: '[product_name]'
                - field: '[id]'
                  copy: '[product_code]'
          - csv:
              loader:
                file_path: 'output.csv'
```

After [building](../../getting-started/compilation) the satellite, start a server in the path `build/`:

```bash
bin/satellite run:hook build/
```

You can then send POST requests containing the data be processed to `http://localhost:8000/my-api`

```yaml
# input:
[
  { product_name: 'test_1', product_code: 861 },
  { product_name: 'test_2', product_code: 862 }
]

# response:
{"message":{"accept":4,"reject":0,"error":0},"server":"my-computer.local"}
  
# output.csv:
sku;id
test_1;861
test_2;862
```

## Advanced usage

### Adding JSON Web Token (JWT) Authorization

```yaml
# ...
    composer:
      require:
        - "tuupola/slim-jwt-auth"
# ...
    http_api:
      authorization:
        jwt:
          secret: 'mysecret'
```

With this config, each requests will need the header __Authorization__:
|header|value|
|-|-|
|`Authorization`|`Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ik`[...]|

The string after "Bearer" is the token, generated from the secret phrase. This site can be used to generate a token from your own secret: [https://jwt.io](https://jwt.io)

### Adding Basic HTTP Authorization

```yaml
# ...
    composer:
      require:
        - "tuupola/slim-basic-auth"
# ...
    http_api:
      authorization:
        basic:
          - user: john
            password: mypassword
          - user: bill
            password: otherpassword
```

The `basic` node is an array, and can contain multiple user/password pairs.

With this configuration, each requests will need the header __Authorization__:
|header|value|
|-|-|
|`Authorization`|`Basic am9objpteXBhc3N3b3Jk`|

The string after "Basic" is the combination `user:password` encoded in Base64.
