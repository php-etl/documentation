We have developed some packages that provide expression functions to allow the use of more complex logic inside your satellites configuration.

These packages are based on the [ExpressionLanguage](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/expression_language.html) Symfony component.

## Satellite Expression functions

[See the Base Expression functions documentation](../expression-language/satellite-expression-functions).

## Array Expression functions

[See the Array Expression functions documentation](../expression-language/array-expression-functions).

## String Expression functions

[See the String Expression functions documentation](../expression-language/string-expression-functions).
